Hi! I am Tyler Fairnington, a first year Astronomy PhD student working with Profs. Jacob Bean and Eliza Kempton at the University of Chicago. I have a broad interest in all things exoplanets, but am primarily interested in understanding populations through connecting atmospheric observations to theory!
