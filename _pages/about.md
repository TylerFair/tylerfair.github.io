Hi! I am Tyler Fairnington, a first year Astronomy PhD student working with Profs. Jacob Bean and Eliza Kempton at the University of Chicago. I have a broad interest in all things exoplanets, but am primarily interested in understanding populations through connecting atmospheric observations to theory! 

I am originally from Gold Coast, Australia, and when I'm not researching you may find me rock climbing, golfing, playing piano or trying to make latte art.
